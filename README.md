# dom-trees

## Overview
There are two approaches to reduce the HTML DOM for capturing user intent. 
##### 1. Eliminate the Extraneous
- **Description**: This method involves identifying and systematically removing tags that are deemed superfluous to user intent.
- **Nature**: Subtractive â€” it refines the DOM by stripping away unnecessary components.

##### 2. Highlight the Essential
- **Description**: Instead of purging unwanted elements, this approach aims to pinpoint and extract the tags that are potentially instrumental in deciphering user intent.

I went with elimiate the extaneous approach because it provides flexibility to address more websites.
